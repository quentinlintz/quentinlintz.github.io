## What is Universal Set?

In set theory, the set of all elements under consideration for a particular problem is denoted by $ \mathbb{U} $.

The _universal set_ acts as context and encompasses every set that can be formed from its elements. 

$$
S \subseteq \mathbb{U}
$$

Set S is a subset of the universal set if every element in set S is also in the universal set U.

Similarly, all knowledge is contextual. I write these articles not as fragmented insights, but to fill in a larger picture of truth. I seek to span a wide array of topics to prove interconnectivity between domains. I hope this blog inspires you to pursue knowledge in unfamiliar fields and remember that every bit of it enriches your quest for truth.
